# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains code for building a content-based movie recommendation system using Python. The recommendation system suggests five related movies for a given movie title based on the concept of Cosine Similarity Metrics and Bag of Words.

### Content-Based Recommendation System:
- Implemented a recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the content/features of a given movie.
- Utilized the Bag of Words concept to represent movie features as vectors.
- Calculated similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity Metrics to recommend relevant options.
